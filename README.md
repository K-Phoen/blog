# My Blog

## Installation

- Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
- Fork this repository
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/K-Phoen/blog.kevingomez.fr`
- Run the jekyll server: `jekyll serve`

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.

## Deployment

You should deploy with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)- it's just
easier.

All you should have to do is rename your repository on GitHub to be
`username.github.com`. Since everything is on the `gh-pages` branch, you
should be able to see your new site at <http://username.github.com>.
