<h1>About me</h1>

<section id="about-me">
    <p>
        My name is Kévin and I am a software engineer specialized in backend applications.
        I started web development as an autodidact in 2008 and acquired a strong knowledge
        and expertise in this field over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        I want this page to be a "<em>not-so-formal</em>" description of who I am,
        my main skills and why I think I am a good software engineer and person to
        work with. For a more formal introduction, you can <a href="/Resume_Kevin-Gomez-Pinto.pdf">download my résumé</a>.

    </p>

    <p>
        Software quality, scalability and Service Oriented Architecture are subjects
        that fascinate me. I do my best to improve myself in these fields but I also
        try to open my perspective to other domains like compilation and static analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
        Generally speaking, I love working and sharing on topics related to software
        architecture and software quality. I like to see myself as a passionate developer,
        an Open Source enthusiast and an eternal learner.
