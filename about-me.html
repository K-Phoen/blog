<h1>About me</h1>

<section id="about-me">
    <p>
        My name is Kévin and I am a software engineer specialized in backend applications.
        I started web development as an autodidact in 2008 and acquired a strong knowledge
        and expertise in this field over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        I want this page to be a "<em>not-so-formal</em>" description of who I am,
        my main skills and why I think I am a good software engineer and person to
        work with. For a more formal introduction, you can <a href="/Resume_Kevin-Gomez-Pinto.pdf">download my résumé</a>.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
        Software quality, scalability and Service Oriented Architecture are subjects
        that fascinate me. I do my best to improve myself in these fields but I also
        try to open my perspective to other domains like compilation and static analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
        Generally speaking, I love working and sharing on topics related to software
        architecture and software quality. I like to see myself as a passionate developer,
        an Open Source enthusiast and an eternal learner.
    </p>

    <h2>What I am looking for</h2>

    <p>
        <b>Challenge motivates me.</b> Even if I have mainly worked on PHP and
        Ruby applications, I crave for opportunities to discover new
        technologies and concepts.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>I love learning.</b> If you use programming languages or tools that I
        have not already mastered, I probably already heard about it and I definitely
        am confident that I can quickly become proficient with it.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>I am interested in various topics.</b> Pure development, architecture and
        clean code, DevOps practices, scalability and performance concerns, monitoring
        and SRE are all topics that I am interested in. And there are a lot more!
    </p>

    <h2>I know things</h2>

    <p>
        <b>I am a good developer.</b> I am really efficient with PHP and I know
        its ecosystem pretty well. Regexes don't frighten me and neither do tricky
        SQL requests or an obscure server configuration.
        <a href="https://github.com/K-Phoen/">My code</a> is clean, tested and
        meant to be readable by humans. In addition to PHP, I know my way around
        <a href="https://github.com/K-Phoen?tab=repositories&language=ruby">Ruby</a>
        and Bash and I have played with
        <a href="https://github.com/K-Phoen?tab=repositories&language=python">Python</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/K-Phoen?tab=repositories&language=go">Go</a>
        and I am interested by Rust.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>I am curious.</b> When I find something interesting or curious, I
        take the time to investigate it. That's how I found out <a href="https://blog.kevingomez.fr/til/2015/07/26/why-is-uniqid-slow/">why PHP's
        <code>uniqid()</code> function is "<em>slow</em>"</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>I am not afraid of specs/RFCs.</b> My knowledge of the
        <a href="https://www.editeur.org/83/Overview/">Onix standard</a>
        and my contributions to TEA's e-book metadata server should be enough
        to prove it. From time to time, I also refer to RFCs like the
        <a href="https://www.editeur.org/83/Overview/">RFC 2616</a>,
        the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807">RFC 7807</a>
        and even the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324">RFC 2324</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>I deliver.</b> I know how to work with a team to do the required job
        within the schedule. I can deal with evolving requirements and I
        coordinate with other teams when necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>I do things</h2>

    <p>
        <b>I had various roles.</b> Depending on the team and the project's
        needs, I can play different roles. Developer, lead developer, architect,
        even "<em>occasional sysadmin</em>" or interviewer for potential new
        colleagues if needed.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>I am not just a developer.</b>
        mentor/teacher
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>I can communicate well.</b>
        pair programming, internal presentations, teaching, talks
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>I contribute to Open-Source software.</b> I created <a href="https://github.com/K-Phoen/">RulerZ</a>,
        maintained <a href="https://github.com/dustin10/VichUploaderBundle/">VichUploaderBundle</a> for some years
        and made contributions to countless projects such as
        <a href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/3621">Kibana</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/3119">PHP-CS-Fixer</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/ovr/phpsa/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AK-Phoen+is%3Aclosed">phpsa</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/aacebedo/dnsdock/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AK-Phoen+is%3Aclosed">dnsdock</a>,
        …
    </p>

    <h2>I'm a nice person</h2>

    <p>
        <b>I am pragmatic.</b> Don't worry, I wont be the one making a tantrum
        because we are not using the latest shiny tool or trendy technology. I
        take the time to think about what problem the team is trying to solve
        and the context of the project to formulate an opinion.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>I have a life outside of work</b> and other interests than software
        engineering so I play well even with <em>non-technical people</em> and
        I don't always talk about work.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>My colleagues like working with me.</b> I am calm even under stress, joyful,
        often making puns, not easily offended and I will not try to convert you to VIM.
        I promise.
    </p>
