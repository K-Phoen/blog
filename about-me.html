<h1>About me</h1>

<section id="about-me">
    <p>
        My name is Kévin and I am a software engineer specialized in backend applications.
        I started web development as an autodidact in 2008 and acquired a strong knowledge
        and expertise in this field over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        I want this page to be a "<em>not-so-formal</em>" description of who I am,
        my main skills and why I think I am a good software engineer and person to
        work with. For a more formal introduction, you can <a href="/Resume_Kevin-Gomez-Pinto.pdf">download my résumé</a>.

    </p>

    <p>
        Software quality, scalability and Service Oriented Architecture are subjects
        that fascinate me. I do my best to improve myself in these fields but I also
        try to open my perspective to other domains like compilation and static analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
        Generally speaking, I love working and sharing on topics related to software
        architecture and software quality. I like to see myself as a passionate developer,
        an Open Source enthusiast and an eternal learner.
    </p>

    <h2>What I am looking for</h2>

    challenge
    learning new technologies/concepts
    interested in dev, architecture, devops and why not SRE

    <h2>I know stuff</h2>

    skillz (tech + communication)
    because of it, I deliver
    know of to handle specs/RFCs (onix)

    <h2>I do stuff</h2>

    dev
    tech lead/architect
    mentor/teacher
    work well under stress
    people like me

    <h2>I'm a nice person</h2>

    <p>
        <b>My colleagues like working with me.</b> I am calm even under stress, smiling,
        often making puns, not easily offended and I will not try to convert you to VIM.<br />
        I have a life outside of work and other interests than software engineering
        so I play well even with <em>non-technical people</em> and I don't always
        have to talk about work.
    </p>
