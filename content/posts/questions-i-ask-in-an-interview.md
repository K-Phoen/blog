As I currently am looking for a company to work with, I took some time to think
about some questions to ask in an interview to gain some insight about the
company, its culture and how it works.

<!--more-->

This list is by no means exhaustive, I mainly use it as a starting point for
discussions.

## General

* What kind of equipment will I be provided? Do I get to choose it?
* What's the longest tenure of a developer at this company? The shortest?
* Are developers allowed to go to conferences? Do you pay for it?

## Management

* Will I have 1:1's with my manager? How often?
* How do you define success and growth for your developers?
* How do you like to track tasks?

## Code-related

* How long do you expect it would take me to deploy my first change? To become productive? To understand the code base?
* How long does it take to do a complete deployment?
* What's your policy regarding tests?
* Do developers get to "explore" solutions, technologies build prototypes? Do they get a defined fraction of time to do so?
* How often do you have major outages? What constitutes a major outage for you?
* How do you balance shipping new features and maintaining the code base?
* How often do developers work in pairs?
* Who is on call?

## Culture

* Do you have a defined process to handle and communicate outages?
* What's the lifecycle of new development, from an idea to deployment?
* How do you decide what to build? When is a feature considered "done"?
* Do you have any form of knowledge sharing?
* Is working remotely allowed? Encouraged?
* What's your favorite thing about the company/your job? You least favorite?
