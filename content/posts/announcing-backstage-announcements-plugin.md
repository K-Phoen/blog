title: "Announcing… a Backstage announcements plugin"

Technical announcements addressed to engineers are usually made in various places: meetings, Slack channels, Confluence pages, e-mails, …

This plethora of communication channels makes it relatively easy to miss out on relevant information when it's announced, and almost impossible to re-discover it after the fact.

What if the single pane of glass provided by an engineering portal such as [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) could be used instead?

With the [`@k-phoen/backstage-plugin-announcements`](https://github.com/K-Phoen/backstage-plugin-announcements/) Backstage plugin, information
can be share directly to engineers via a tool they already use every day: their portal.

New information will be highlighted, making sure that nothing gets unnoticed, and previous announcements will always be readable in the plugin or
discoverable within Backstage' search engine!
