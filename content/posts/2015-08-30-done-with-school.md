That's it. After five years spent learning computer science in various schools
and universities, I'm finally free!

I had the chance to work for several companies in addition to being a student
and I really am eager to get involved in other projects.

Speaking of which, I am more than happy that the company in which I did my last
internship gave me the opportunity to keep working with them. Starting from the
14th of September I will officially stop being a student and become a full-time
developer at [TEA â€” The Ebook Alternative](http://www.tea-ebook.com/).
I'm really glad to have the possibility to work on a project that I love and
in which I believe. Even more glad to work with coworkers as amazing and
qualified as the ones who work at TEA.

I remember writing my first website as a hobby when I was twelve. I find it
funny to see that it has become a real passion and my job!
