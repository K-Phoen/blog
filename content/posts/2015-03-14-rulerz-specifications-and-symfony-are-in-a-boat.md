title: RulerZ, specifications and Symfony are in a boat
description: I already introduced [RulerZ and the reasoning behind it](/2015/02/07/on-taming-repository-classes-in-doctrine-among-other-things/). This time I'll showcase its integration with Symfony and the Form Component.

    Using RulerZ and Symfony you can:

    * use specification objects inside Doctrine repositories to query your data ;
    * make the Form component build specification objects for you.

In [my previous post](http://blog.kevingomez.fr/2015/02/07/on-taming-repository-classes-in-doctrine-among-other-things/),
I tried to answer the following question: **how do you keep your Doctrine
repositories from growing exponentially**?
Long story short, I came up with a generic solution based on the
[Specification pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern) that
essentially **abstracts and simplifies** the way we write and compose **queries**.
And the best part is that it works with Doctrine but also with any other
data-source.

**[RulerZ](https://github.com/K-Phoen/rulerz) was born**.

Of course, there was a real need behind my previous question. For one of my
current projects, I wanted to be able to switch from one data-source to another.
My application would use Doctrine in development and production environment but
for tests I wanted my data to live in memory.

First thing first, I needed to be able to **manipulate** my **data**.

To achieve that, I defined a `CompanyRepository` interface — it's a
small project that mainly deals with *companies* — and wrote two classes
implementing it: one using Doctrine and another one storing my objects in memory.

In the beginning, I only needed to save a company and retrieve it by it's slug
so both implementations were simple and it all worked as expected. The real
issue came when I started to implement a search engine. For each new search
criteria, I had to update two classes and implement the same criteria twice.

At this point, my repositories looked like this:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
interface CompanyRepository
{
    public function save(Company $company);
    public function find($slug);
    public function search(array $criteria = []);
}

class DoctrineCompanyRepository extends EntityRepository implements CompanyRepository
{
    // ...

    public function search(array $criteria = [])
    {
        $qb = $this->createQueryBuilder('c');

        if (!empty($criteria['name'])) {
            $qb
                ->andWhere('c.name LIKE :name')
                ->setParameter('name', sprintf('%%%s%%', $criteria['name']));
        }

        // other criteria

        return $qb->getQuery()->getResult();
    }
}

class InMemoryCompanyRepository implements CompanyRepository
{
    // ...

    public function search(array $criteria = [])
    {
        $companies = $this->companies;

        if (!empty($criteria['name'])) {
            $companies = array_filter($companies, function($company) use ($criteria) {
                return stripos(strtolower($company->getName()), strtolower($criteria['name'])) !== false;
            });
        }

        // other criteria

        return $companies;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The first issue is that my `CompanyRepository::search(array $criteria)`
method violates the [open/closed principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle).
This is solved by replacing the `$criteria` parameter by [specifications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern).
Each specification representing a single search criteria.

The second issue is that with *"classic"* specifications, the same specification
can't be used to filter data from several data-sources. We saw that with RulerZ,
this [problem is solved](http://blog.kevingomez.fr/2015/02/07/on-taming-repository-classes-in-doctrine-among-other-things/).

**Using RulerZ**, the two previous repositories can be refactored:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
interface CompanyRepository
{
    public function save(Company $company);
    public function find($slug);
    public function matchingSpec(Specification $spec);
}

class DoctrineCompanyRepository extends EntityRepository implements CompanyRepository
{
    // ...

    public function matchingSpec(Specification $spec)
    {
        $qb = $this->createQueryBuilder('c');

        return $this->rulerz->filterSpec($qb, $spec);
    }
}

class InMemoryCompanyRepository implements CompanyRepository
{
    private $companies = [];

    // ...

    public function matchingSpec(Specification $spec)
    {
        return $this->rulerz->filterSpec($this->companies, $spec);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

You probably noticed a <small>not so</small> subtle difference compared to the
old repositories: I rely on RulerZ so I have to inject it somehow. Lucky me,
I'm working on a Symfony application and there is [a bundle for that](https://github.com/K-Phoen/RulerZBundle)!

As **RulerZ** is now properly **integrated into my repositories** and I'm able
to query my data, I need to address the **specification-creation issue**.
Remember, I was trying to implement a search engine so **how do I map a search**
as expressed by a user (through a form for instance) **to a specification**?

The idea here is to map a user input — a search criteria — to a specification.
A string (or a scalar) to an object. Using Symfony Form component. Looks a lot
like a **[DataTransformer](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/form/data_transformers.html)**
don't you think?

With that in mind, I wrote the following form type:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
class CompanySearchType extends AbstractType
{
    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
    {
        $terms = $builder
            ->create('who')
            ->addModelTransformer(
                new SpecToStringTransformer(Spec\CompanyName::class, 'terms')
            );

        $location = $builder
            ->create('where')
            ->addModelTransformer(
                new SpecToStringTransformer(Spec\CompanyLocation::class, 'location')
            );

        $builder
            ->add($terms)
            ->add($location);
    }

    // ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

The form type itself is pretty straightforward, the only thing to notice is the
usage of `SpecToStringTransformer`. It takes two parameters: the
<abbr title="Fully-Qualified Class Name">FQCN</abbr> of the specification to
build and a property in this specification containing the value.
The transformer's code itself isn't really important but if you really want to
read it, it's available as [a gist](https://gist.github.com/K-Phoen/5c1b06a864d063c1ee4e#file-data_transformer-php).

What's important is that combining the Form Component, a simple transformer and
RulerZ leads to really simple controllers:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
public function searchAction(Request $request)
{
    $results = [];
    $form = $this->formFactory->create('company_search');
    $form->handleRequest($request);

    if ($form->isValid()) {
        $spec = new Spec\AndX(array_merge(        // aggregate specifications
            array_filter($form->getData()),       // remove empty fields/specs
            array(new AppSpec\CompanyPublished()) // only display published companies
        ));
        $results = $this->companyRepository->matchingSpec($spec);
    }

    return $this->render('...');
}
{% endhighlight %}

Do you see the magic? A classic **form type** can automatically **build
specifications** that can be used to **retrieve data** from a Doctrine repository,
an in-memory repository or virtually any other data-source.
Also, adding new search criteria boils down to writing its specification and
adding a new field in the form type. How cool is that?
