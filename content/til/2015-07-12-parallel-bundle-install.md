title: Parallel bundle install
category: til

In ruby projects, the `bundle install` command is known to be quite slow. To
mitigate this, Bundler provides an option allowing to install gems using
parallel workers: `bundle install --jobs 4`. Just tell Bundler how many
concurrent jobs can be launched and let it work.
