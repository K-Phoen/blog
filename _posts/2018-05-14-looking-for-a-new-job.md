After three years as a software engineer at [TEA — The Ebook Alternative](https://www.tea-ebook.com/),
**I quit my job**, I left my flat and I took my backpack and my shoes to travel
across Europe… in part to look for a job.

## Why did I quit?

When I was hired, one of my personal goals was to benefit from the knowledge
and experience of my coworkers to improve myself.

*TEA* was — and still is — a company where talented people are building a
relatively complex platform and where I learned a lot by their side: I improved my
knowledge of PHP, I learned new languages, I helped introduce a testing culture,
I developed my skills in architecture, project management and teamwork. I even
gave [a few talks](/talks/) in some big conferences.

But after a while, I felt like I was stagnating.

I felt comfortable in this company and [I was absolutely not afraid of Mondays](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/weekend.png)
but the excitement was gone. My work was not really challenging anymore.

That's why I decided that it was time for me to move on to something different. 
Something that would stimulate and challenge me everyday, where I could learn
new stuff and also maybe have a more positive impact on the outside world.

## What am I looking for?

That's a good question: what kind of job am I looking for? What does
« stimulating » mean? Instead of « stimulating », maybe I should say « meaningful ».

Even if the technical aspect and the continuous improvement are extremely
important for me, they aren't the only ones that matter. I am also looking for
some kind of *ethical* dimension in my work and I actively avoid unethical jobs.

But what does all that even mean? Short answer: I don't really know.

I am not looking for « [we're making the world a better place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRUAJVKlUZQ) »-style companies.
I am more interested in being useful while respecting my values. I enjoy working
on interesting projects and ideally I would also like to have an impact while
improving myself. Both technically and humanly.

> * What's the company's goal?
> * Who are their customers?
> * How could I be useful to both?
> * By working for them, will I go against my values?
> * Will I learn new things?

That's the kind of questions I have in mind when I say « *meaningful* work ».

Working for Mozilla and being able to have a positive impact on literally
millions of users would be awesome. But I'm also perfectly fine
with smaller projects and impacts.

For instance, I would love working with researchers in biology or physics. I
could make my technical expertise available and contribute with my skills to
help them in their day to day work.  
Another thing I can totally see myself do is providing tools for other teams
and developers. Working in an SRE team would be awesome too.

And doing that abroad would be even better!

## So, what's next?

In the immediate future, I will probably start by having fun during my trip
across Europe. And while doing that, I'll try to meet developers and companies
along the way.
