November 24th 2015, I gave my first *big* talk at the Forum PHP conference,
organized by the [AFUP](http://afup.org/pages/site/) in Paris.

Despite the stress, my talk went well and the audience seem to agree with me
(at least according to [their ratings on joind.in](https://joind.in/talk/view/15276)).

For those who couldn't attend my talk, you can still find [the slides online](blog.kevingomez.fr/slides-forum-php-2015/)
and have a look at the speaker's notes (press the <kdb>S</kdb> key on your keyboard).
Sorry for those who don't speak french: even if the slides are in english, my notes aren't.
That being said, do not hesitate to ask me if you have questions, I'd be more
than happy to answer them!

When I take a few steps back and think of the two days spent in this conference,
I only see good things. I spoke for the first time in front of a **lot of
people** (the auditorium was big enough for 230 people, I'd say that around
150-180 attended my talk) and several people came to talk about RulerZ and other
open-source project I maintain and these discussions have led to some nice ideas
(teasing!).

Actually meeting people with which I've worked on open-source
projects was also awesome!

In a nutshell, I had a really good time, I've met a lot of awesome people and I
hope that I'll be able to attend again a conference soon! Or even better, I hope
that I'll be able to give another talks about RulerZ or some other stuffâ€¦ maybe
for the [PHP Tour 2016 in Clermont-Ferrand](http://clermontech.org/blog-posts/phptour-2016-a-clermont-ferrand.html)?

Aniway, thank you guys from Afup for organizing this great event!
