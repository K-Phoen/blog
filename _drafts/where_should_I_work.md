After three years as a software engineer at [TEA — The Ebook Alternative](https://www.tea-ebook.com/),
**I quit my job**, my flat and I am leaving with my backpack to travel across
Europe… in part to look for a job.

## Why did I quit?

When I was hired (as an « *expert-beginner* »), one of my goals was to benefit
from the knowledge and experience of my coworkers to improve myself.

*TEA* was — and still is — a company where talented people were building a
relatively complex platform and I learned a lot by their side: I improved my
knowledge of PHP, I learned new languages, I developed my skills in architecture,
project management and teamwork. I even gave [a few talks](/talks/) in some
big conferences.

But after a while, I felt like I was stagnating.

I felt comfortable in this company and [I was absolutely not afraid of Mondays](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/weekend.png)
but the excitement of the technical difficulty was gone. My work wasn't really
challenging anymore.

That's why I decided that it was time for me to move on to something different. 
Something that would stimulate me and make me surpass myself.

## What am I looking for?

That's a good question: what kind of job am I looking for? What does
« stimulating » mean? Instead of « stimulating », maybe I should say « meaningful ».

Even if the technical aspect and the continuous improvement are extremely
important aspects for me, they aren't the only ones to matter. I am also looking
for some kind of *ethical* dimension in my work.

But what does all that even mean? Short answer: I don't really know.

I am not looking for « [we're making the world a better place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRUAJVKlUZQ) »-style companies.
I am more interested in being useful while respecting my values. I would love
to be helpful while improving myself. Both technically and humanly.

> * What's the company's goal?
> * Who are their customers?
> * How could I be useful to both?
> * By working for them, will I go against my values?
> * Will I learn new things?

That's the kind of things I have in mind when I say « *meaningful* work ».

Working for Mozilla and being able to have a positive impact on literally
millions of users would be awesome. But I'm also perfectly fine
with smaller projects and impact.

For instance, I would love working with researchers in biology or physics. I
could make my technical expertise available to them or build tools to help them
in their work.

I can totally see myself providing tools for other teams and developers. Working
in an SRE team would be awesome too.

And doing that abroad would be even better!

## So, what's next?

In the immediate future, I will probably start by enjoying my trip in Europe.
And while I do that, I'll try to meet developers and companies along the way.
